# java-svc
This repository contains a set of small examples that can be used to demonstrate various popular Java serviceability technologies.

## Prerequisites
The projects require JDK 8 or later, and should all work with JDK 11, unless otherwise specified.

You will also need to have Maven 3.5.3+ installed.

## Building
To build all the projects, simply run:

```bash
mvn package
```

The projects can also be built individually by entering the subprojects. Some projects may require a `mvn install` of a dependent project to be built in such a manner.

## Running the Projects
Check the README.md files in the subfolders for instructions on how to run the examples.
