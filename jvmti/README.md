# JVMTI

The JVM Tooling Interface is a native interface to the JVM used to build powerful JVM (Java Virtual Machine) tools. It was created by fusing the former JVMDI (JVM Debugger Interface) and JVMPI (JVM Profiling Interface) interfaces. Every Java developer who has used a debugger has used JVMTI (normally through JDP/JDWP).
