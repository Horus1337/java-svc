# JDI

JDI (Java Debug Interface) is the Java API used to implement a Java debugger. Different ways to connect are available, but most Java developers probably have experience starting an application in debug mode, setting breakpoints and looking at method parameter values etc. A common and powerful use case is to connect to the JVM remotely using JDWP (the Java Debug Wire Protocol).

This folder contains examples doing exactly that - remotely connecting to a running JVM.
